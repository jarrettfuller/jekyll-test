&lt;p&gt;If there is one art form that will come to define the 21st century, it will be collage. The internet has made visual resources abundant and all of us — from fine art painters to filmmakers, musicians to moms, designers to teenagers — use this imagery to make art, populate Pinterest boards, and organize memories. This century will be described as a remix culture — we sample and borrow, remix and reuse, appropriate and, yes, collage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collage techniques have been employed since the invention of paper in China around 200BC. But the modern use of collage — the way we think about it as cutting things apart and putting them together in new ways — emerged in the early 1900s out of the Cubist movement when Picasso and Braque began pasting ephemera into their paintings. Braque cut up pieces of wallpaper to add to his charcoal drawings and Picasso soon followed, adding bits of cloth into his own paintings. Collage — and its many subgenres including photomontage, decoupage, and mosaic — has found its way into every movement, with every medium, in contemporary art: the Surrealists used collage extensively, pop artists like Lichtenstein and Warhol worked in collage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hockneypictures.com/works_photos.php&quot;&gt;David Hockney used his own photography&lt;/a&gt; as a base for collages, and Matisse, late in his career as he began losing mobility, famously turned to cutting up pieces of paper to create colorful murals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Left: 2x4's Prada Wallpaper. Right: Raf Simons' 2015 Spring collection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collage has become the defacto metaphor for post-modernism and it isn’t limited to the fine arts. The montage became a popular film trope. Sound collage, or sampling, has increasingly become popular in music composition. In the 1960s, architects like &lt;a href=&quot;http://jarrettfuller.tumblr.com/tagged/superstudio&quot;&gt;SuperStudio&lt;/a&gt; and Rem Koolhaas used collage to imagine alternate futures and impossible architectures. In design, 2x4 frequently employs collage in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://2x4.org/work/9/prada-wallpapers/&quot;&gt;epic wallpapers for Prada’s flagship store in SoHo&lt;/a&gt;, Raf Simons’ 2015 Spring collection subverted the moodboard form by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefashionlaw.com/home/a-closer-look-at-raf-simons-springsummer-2015-collection&quot;&gt;printing his influences directly on the garments&lt;/a&gt;, and Ed Fella has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edfella.com/collage.html&quot;&gt;producing paper collages&lt;/a&gt; for over a quarter-century. Walter Benjamin described his epic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Arcades-Project-Walter-Benjamin/dp/0674008022/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1474987021&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+arcades+project&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arcades Project&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a friend as his attempt to use collage in literature. The journalist Janet Malcolm — who also works as a collagist — found inspiration in her visual work when writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/07/11/forty-one-false-starts&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forty-One False Starts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; profile of the artist David Salle, when she assembled the profile as a series of forty-one possible first-paragraphs, reminding me of Woody Allen’s voiceover at the beginning of Manhattan. And a few years ago, Jonathan Letham wrote an essay on plagiarism and influence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://harpers.org/archive/2007/02/the-ecstasy-of-influence/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ecstasy of Influence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which he assembled by borrowing — collaging — every paragraph from preexisting texts into something wholly new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://68.media.tumblr.com/dd13f367400e7aec9c2993cab33c3feb/tumblr_inline_oe63gbOnag1qzwy5u_500.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a vivid memory of visiting the Philadelphia Art Museum as a high student and seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artsy.net/artwork/robert-rauschenberg-estate&quot;&gt;Robert Rauchsenberg’s 1963 piece, &lt;i&gt;Estate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and being immediately struck by its vibrant collage-like aesthetic. Rauschenberg was beginning to move off the flat canvas, fixing objects on to his canvases to break the two dimensional plane for new pieces he was calling “combines” — a sort of elaborated collage. You could trace much of my early work back to that single artwork. I was drawn to Rauschenberg’s use of layering, of mixing imagery, and combining photos, drawings, and objects. Years later, collage has remained a seminal touchstone to which I habitually return. I’ve been wondering why this medium has held my interest for so long. Why do I find myself continually drawn to artists working in collage? And why does so much of my own work employ collage methods and aesthetics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started looking, I quickly realized that everyone I was interested in and inspired by were working the same way. Collage is synecdochic of the creative process. It’s our process made visual. The design process always begins with collage. We may have moved from the traditional cut-out and pinned-up moodboards to digital Pinterest boards — but the action is the same: we pull from our influences and inspirations, using the fragments of what came before in search of something new. Design is both a noun and a verb, the action and the artifact and so is collage. It is a noun — a complete object — but also a verb — the action of &lt;i&gt;collaging&lt;/i&gt;, of connecting disparate parts into a coherent whole. In my first design classes we learned about &lt;i&gt;gestalt&lt;/i&gt;, that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. Collage reflexively teaches gestalt — a single work that also reveals the individual elements. All design is, in essence, collaged. It’s is taking preexisting forms — shapes, typography, images — and &lt;i&gt;collaging&lt;/i&gt; them into a coherent whole. And the same is true for the writer — where the designer pieces together shapes and imagery, the writer pieces together words. A sentence a collage of words; a paragraph a collage of sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collage is the perfect metaphor for the creative practice, the visual manifestation of the design process. It is both the artifact and the research. You can look at archives, indexes, and collections as a form of collage. I think about Gehard Ricter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Gerhard-Richter-Atlas-Helmut-Friedel/dp/1933045477/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1474986955&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=gerhard+richter+atlas&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atlas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a collection of his inspirations, research, and preoccupations. “In the online world the only thing you’re the master of is your collection, your archive, and how you use it, how you remix it.” writes the poet Kenneth Goldsmith in his new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Wasting-Time-Internet-Kenneth-Goldsmith/dp/0062416472/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1474986937&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=wasting+time+on+the+internet+by+kenneth+goldsmith&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wasting Time on the Internet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “We become digital archivists, collecting and cataloging things.” My Evernote account is my own ever-expanding &lt;i&gt;Atlas&lt;/i&gt;. The internet is producing a vibrant community of samplers, remixers, and collectors. Our collections have become public, open to new interpretations, new collages. This is how all art is made: we take what’s come before us and make something new out of it. It’s reflexive in revealing its process and showing its influences and elements and authentic in representing its process and how we see the world. Collage, like design and writing, is a framing device that helps us seek gestalt and make sense of the world around us. As the architect Juhani Pallasmaa writes: “Our very consciousness is an ever-changing collage of mental fragments held together by one’s sense of self.” Our art always mimics life — a collage of memories and experiences. &amp;#10006;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay" /><summary type="html">If there is one art form that will come to define the 21st century, it will be collage.

The class focused on interface design and user experience for mobile devices. Here's MICA's official class description:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this course, explore the process for developing digital products that serve users’ needs. Students will prototype screen-based experiences that are empathetic to the needs of the end user. Students will develop design concepts that mediate relationships between people and products, environments, and services. Key concepts might include content strategy, navigation structures, usability principles, personas, and wireframes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The class was structured around three main projects that increased in complexity begining with designing a new feature for a stock iOS app to developing an application with multiple interfaces across platforms (mobile, watch, internet of things). Rooted in theory, the class focused on looking at interface and user experience design as a lens through which all design could be judged. The syllabus, readings, and assignments can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarrettfuller.github.io/dux/&quot;&gt;the class site&lt;/a&gt; and below is a revised transcript of the lecture I gave on the first day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this class to be a mix of practice and theory. We're going to work on three projects. Each week you'll have a research project and I'll assign a selection of readings. I don't want you to end this class just with the ability to make pretty apps or interesting interfaces. I want you to be able to defend your decisions, and rationalize design choices based on the concepts of user experience based on research, surveys, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started I think it's important to define some of our term and begin at the base level with the concept of the interface. Throughout this class, we're going to be focusing on the mobile phone, and for our first project the iPhone. But one of the recurring themes you'll see in this class is that interfaces are much more than that (and obviously, user experience isn't just limited to mobile apps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite definition of the interface is from Giancarlo Barbacetto. He was an italian critic who wrote a book called &lt;i&gt;Design Interface&lt;/i&gt; in 1987.He described the interface &quot;as whatever lies between:&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever ‘lies between’ is called interface, whatever
allows us to link two different elements, to reconcile them, to put them into communication.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barbacetto uses the Rosetta Stone as an example of one of the first interfaces.
A shared surface which facilitates communication between otherwise irreconcilable languages and cultures.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ux_rosetta.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think is interesting about an interface is it's always a product of its culture.&amp;#8201;
It’s made in a specific time and place to be used in a specific time and place and design decisions reflect shared conventions, assumptions, and histories from that setting.
An interface designed &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt; will not necessarily work 20 years in the future. And what's exciting about thinking about designing interfaces today —  in 2016 — is that we're seeing a big change in how we interact with technologies. Software is slowly replacing everything — from our watches to our cars to our thermostats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The familiar interfaces we've known are moving to screens, and screens are usually the territory of the desigtner, so we have tremendous power in affecting how humans interact, both with machines and with each other. And very recently we're seeing interfaces that don't even have a visible element. We can talk to our computers. We can have devices in our homes that we simply speak to and they do something. You have things like Amazon's Dash buttons — which you put in your cabinets and when you're out, you just press the button and Amazon orders a new one — and the Echo, that doesn't even have a screen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to come back to Barbacetto's definition. I like it because it doesn't talk about software or hardware or flat versus skeumorphic. It just says an interface puts two things in communication. In Barbacetto's definition, the Rosetta Stone is an interface.
The transmission of information — of messages, of content, of language — is the interface. Which means, that a book could be considered an interface. Or a poster. Or website. Or a magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to argue that we could say &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; graphic design is interface design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so while we'll be focusing on apps and mobile devices in this class, I want to us to consider how the principles and theories we learn over the next few weeks can be applied to your other design work. Which, of course, brings us to the most important question: what is &lt;i&gt;user experience&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do a Google image search for user experience you get these weird diagrams
    these strange color wheel looking graphics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ux_google.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Wikipedia defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;the overall &lt;b&gt;experience&lt;/b&gt; of a person &lt;b&gt;using&lt;/b&gt; a product such as a website or computer application, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis there is mine because when I was in school, we were told when we were defining a word, we couldn't use the word in the definition. And this definition uses both words! It's still kind of vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse James Garrett is one of the forefathers of user experience and he developed this diagram to explain it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ux_diagram.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrett puts visual design — the part we're probably most familiar with — on the top half, the latter part of the process, but there's this whole other part of the process that needs to happen before we can start designing. We need to figure out the goal of the interface, how we're going to measure it, what are the features it will have.
Before we even start designing, we need to plan and account for all sorts of variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the experiences of using these two apps: Microsoft Word and Apple pages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ux_text.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both text editors, they do essentially the same thing. But the interfaces are different and therefore the user experience is different. Where Word puts a lot of features across the top, Apple hides them in slide out panels. What are the feelings you have using each app? Microsoft decided it's users want to customize their pages so they put those features right at the top. Apple thought users wanted to focus on what they were writing, so they hid everything. Neither is right or wrong, but they are after different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another, non-technical example: Wal-Mart and Trader Joes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/ux_store.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sell groceries but both offer fundamental different experiences. Walk into Wal Mart and you're greeted by a nice old person. The lights are bright and all the signs are the same, shouting at you. At Trader Joes, they want to be seen as a local grocer so all their signs are handprinted. They use woods and natural materials. The cashier will ask what you're doing this weekend.The &lt;i&gt;interfaces&lt;/i&gt; of these two stores are different, communicating different desires and fundamentally changing the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to think about it is user experience is branding at a personal level. It's a way to communicate the desires, messages, and mission of your company or product. Branding is about finding an audience and communicating to them — a brand is a type of interface. Think of the Apple store — probably the best retail experience today. There are no lines, they come to you when you're ready to check out. You can play with all the computers and try on an Apple Watch. Something broken? Go to the genius bar. They've designed the entire experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to another question: how do you design an experience? Can you?
Not really. But you can set up a framework for to help push people to the desire experience you want. As designers, we do that through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interactions (whether physical, like in store or technical, like on a screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;visuals (how it looks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;content (the words used, how we communicate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;motion (how do things move on screen but also how the user/customer/audience moves through your interface)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to quickly talk about the differences between User Experience and User Interface. User experience deals a lot with psychology, marketing, behavior. It's about research — figuring out what competitors do and who your customers are. User Experience is works through the product structure and develops wireframes and user flows and figures out how success will be measured. User interface is focused on the literal, physical interactions. They develop branding guidelines, work on interactivity and responsiveness, and the look and feel of the app. Both of them are focused on the user and delivering the best experience to accomplish those goals through prototyping, wireframes, and user flows. The shorthand way to think about is is that the interface is the visual manifestation of the experience. They go completely hand in hand. In this class, we won't just be making nice interfaces but also thinking about user personas, researching competitors, developing prototypes and writing copy that encourages the user to do what we want them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's this great quote from the design critic Max Bruinsma who said &quot;a design today is rarely a substantive, realized product. More and more often it is a proposal, that gains its final form in the interaction with the audience, for better or for worse.&quot;  He's talking  about designing an interaction, designing an experience. He's talking  about user experience and graphic design. Which of course means: all graphic design is about user experience. In this class, we're going to get into specifics about how think about that — from design patterns to default settings. And my hope is, as I've said before, even though we're focusing on apps, you'll see processes you can use in all your design work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Teaching" /><summary type="html">During the Fall 2016 semester, I taught Design for User Experience at Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, MD.
