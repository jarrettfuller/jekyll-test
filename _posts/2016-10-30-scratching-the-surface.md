discription: Scratching the Surface is a weekly design podcast about the intersection
  of criticism and practice. Each week, I interview designers, writers, critics, educators
  and those that operate between these fields about how writing, criticism, and theory
  informs individual practice and the graphic design profession at large. Previous
  guests have included Michael Rock, Michael Bierut, Alexandra Lange, Jessica Helfand,
  Steven Heller, and others.
