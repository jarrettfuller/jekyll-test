discription: Published in 2016, <i>I Don't Know What Graphic Design Is</i>, is a collection
  of my essays on design, culture, and technology from the last five years. Ranging
  from criticism, book reviews, and theoretical texts, this book captures my thinking
  on design and uncovers the common themes that I've returned to again and again.
  Printed in black and white, using only Helvetica, the simple layout emphasizes the
  print-on-demand form while also putting the words first.
