discription: Wondermade is a new confectionary in Orlando, FL focused on superior
  marshmallows in a variety of flavors including blueberry, pumpkin, and Guinness.
  The company approached me to design an e-commerce site to sell their marshmallows.
  Working off the existing branding (from <a href="http://theheadsofstate.com/">The
  Heads of State</A>), we created a fun, textured site that reflects the packaging
  and echoes the unboxing experiences.
