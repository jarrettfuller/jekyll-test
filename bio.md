<div class="profile">
<div class="text">

<p>I am a writer living in Brooklyn, NY. I have contributed to publications including <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>New Republic</i>, <i>Businessweek</i>, <i>n+1</i>, and many others. My work takes the form of reportage, criticism, and essays on topics that range from technology to political media, visual art, business, and architecture. My favorite writing dissects systems of cultural production and the manufacturing of cultural authority.</p>

<p>My first book, an essay on minimalism, will be published in the United States by Bloomsbury in 2019. My writing has also been included as chapters in <i>Reading Pop Culture: A Portable Anthology</i> (Bedford St. Martinâ€™s, 2013) and <i>A Companion to Digital Art</i> (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015). I am represented by Caroline Eisenmann at Frances Goldin Literary Agency.</p>

<p>I graduated from Tufts University in 2010, studying International Relations with a focus on China and art history. I have held staff jobs at <i>Leap</i>, an art magazine in Beijing; Hyperallergic, a Brooklyn art blog; and Artinfo. I have worked as a freelance writer since 2012.</p>

<p>I also organized several art exhibitions as a curator. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/selfie-art-one-gallery-thinks-so-445"><i>National #Selfie Portrait Gallery</i></a> was installed at the Moving Image London Art Fair in 2013 and received wide media coverage; <a href="http://garisandhahn.com/portfolio/dying-on-stage-new-painting-in-new-york/"><i>Dying on Stage: New Painting in New York</i></a> was installed at Garis & Hahn gallery in the Lower East Side in 2013; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/12/vine-twitter-moving-image-art-fair"><i>Shortest Video Art Ever $old!</i></a> was installed at Moving Image New York 2013.</p>

<p>In 2015, I founded the freelance journalist collective <a href="http://studyhall.xyz">Study Hall</a> with Peter Moskowitz. Based in Brooklyn, Study Hall coordinates shared office space, live events, and a digital community for independent writers. </p>
